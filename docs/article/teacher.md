Hi Jojo Shum,

It's 08:00 2023-03-03 now.
AI002L1-10-2023S class starts at 19:00 2023-03-02 ET.
Please always submit student attendance at the start of class.
Click here to submit: https://school.thinkland.ai/user/index.php?id=1759

Why it is important to always submit class attendance at the start of the class::
1. Send a reminder message to absent students and/or their parents. You can submit multiple times.
2. Save a record of you starting the class on time, in case that the parents ask about it later.
3. We don’t want any student to miss a class. You can DM the OPERATION team (Derek, Dragon371#6098) in Discord to contact the parents through other ways such as text message.
4. How to submit: https://school.thinkland.ai/attendance/

Best Regards,
Thinkland.ai Office

It's 7:26pm 2023-03-02.

Why to submit class attendance at the start of the class？
1. We want to do our best to get students to come to the class on time. If you submitted at the beginning of the class, the no-show message might be able to get to the student/parents and remind them of the class.
2. If You can DM the OPERATION team (Derek, Dragon371#6098) in Discord earlier, they may be able to contact the parents through other ways such as text message.
3. Save a record of you starting the class ON TIME, in case that the parents ask about it later.

Please remember to submit class attendance at the start of the class, always!
It is important to do so, because
1. We want to do our best to get students to come to the class on time. If you submitted at the beginning of the class, the no-show message might be able to get to the student/parents and remind them of the class.
2. If You can DM the OPERATION team (Derek, Dragon371#6098) in Discord earlier, they may be able to contact the parents through other ways such as text message.

Hi Katherine,

Could you please write the Evaluation and Recommendation for your students this week?

We need the time and information to communicate with their parents for class renewal next session.

Please provide as much information as you can - be encouraging but honest. FYI, below are some evaluation examples that other teachers have written:
